=head1 NAME

Calendar::Any::Gregorian - Perl extension for Gregorian Calendar

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Calendar::Any::Gregorian;
   my $date = Calendar::Any::Gregorian->new(1, 1, 2006);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

From "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT CALENDARS"(C<http://www.tondering.dk/claus/calendar.html>)

=over

The Gregorian calendar is the one commonly used today. It was proposed
by Aloysius Lilius, a physician from Naples, and adopted by Pope
Gregory XIII in accordance with instructions from the Council of Trent
(1545-1563) to correct for errors in the older Julian Calendar. It was
decreed by Pope Gregory XIII in a papal bull on 24 February 1582. This
bull is named "Inter Gravissimas" after its first two words.

In the Gregorian calendar, the tropical year is approximated as
365 97/400 days = 365.2425 days. Thus it takes approximately 3300
years for the tropical year to shift one day with respect to the
Gregorian calendar.

The approximation 365 97/400 is achieved by having 97 leap years
every 400 years.
